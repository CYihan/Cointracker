# Cointracker

The following is a mobile application to track cryptocurrency market data inspired by CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and many others. The project is a Work In Progress, and is not fully functional yet.

## Getting Started

```
yarn global add react ts-node typescript expo
```

From the root folder, `yarn install`

Navigate to the `/server` folder and run `ts-node server.ts` to run the authentication server

From the root folder, `yarn start` to run

Use the Expo Go app on iOS store on Google Play store to access the app on a mobile device

# Note

In `LoginScreen.tsx` and `server.ts`, you will want to replace the API URL with your own IP Address. A fix for this will be implemented very soon
